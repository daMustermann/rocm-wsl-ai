# üî• ROCm-WSL-AI üöÄ

> **Supercharge your AMD GPU for AI in Windows Subsystem for Linux!**

This repository provides a streamlined setup for running AI workloads (like Stable Diffusion) on AMD GPUs using ROCm within Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2).

Try the "Other GPU" branch if you got a Radeon GPU that is not a 7900XTX and report back!

## üéØ Features

- ‚úÖ Automated ROCm installation for WSL2
- ‚úÖ PyTorch with ROCm support setup
- ‚úÖ ComfyUI installation and configuration
- ‚úÖ ComfyUI Manager for easy extension management
- ‚úÖ SD.Next installation and configuration
- ‚úÖ Auto-detection of AMD GPU architecture
- ‚úÖ Support for RDNA3, RDNA2, RDNA1, Vega, and Polaris GPUs
- ‚úÖ Compatible with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

- Unified menu for all AI tools installation
- Option to install ROCm and PyTorch (required first)
- ComfyUI installation and startup
- SD.Next installation and startup
- Installation status checks
- Color-coded output for better readability
- Handles dependencies between components

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `1_setup_pytorch_rocm_wsl.sh`

This script sets up the foundation for AI development with AMD GPUs:

- Auto-detects your AMD GPU model and architecture
- Configures the appropriate settings for your specific GPU
- Installs AMD ROCm drivers for WSL2
- Configures necessary user groups
- Creates a Python virtual environment (`genai_env`)
- Installs PyTorch with ROCm support
- Installs Triton for optimized performance
- Performs verification checks to ensure everything is working

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `2_install_comfyui.sh`

This script installs ComfyUI, a powerful UI for Stable Diffusion, along with ComfyUI Manager:

- Activates the previously created virtual environment
- Clones the ComfyUI repository
- Installs all required Python dependencies
- Installs ComfyUI Manager for easy extension and model management
- Provides instructions for running ComfyUI

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `3_start_comfyui.sh`

A convenience script to easily start ComfyUI:

- Activates the Python virtual environment
- Navigates to the ComfyUI directory
- Launches ComfyUI with any provided arguments
- Handles error checking and proper environment setup

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ `4_install_sdnext.sh`

This script installs SD.Next, another powerful UI for Stable Diffusion:

- Verifies ROCm and PyTorch installation
- Clones the SD.Next repository
- Configures SD.Next for AMD GPU support
- Provides instructions for running SD.Next with ROCm

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 11 with WSL2 enabled
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS installed in WSL2
- Compatible AMD GPU:
  - RDNA3 (RX 7000 series) - Best performance
  - RDNA2 (RX 6000 series) - Great performance
  - RDNA1 (RX 5000 series) - Good performance
  - Vega (Vega 56/64, Radeon VII) - Compatible
  - Polaris (RX 400/500 series) - Basic compatibility
- Latest AMD drivers installed in Windows

### Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/daMustermann/rocm-wsl-ai.git
   cd rocm-wsl-ai
   ```

2. Make the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

3. (Recommended) Use the menu interface:
   ```bash
   ./0_ai_tools_menu.sh
   ```
   > üí° **Tip**: The menu script provides an interactive interface for all installation and startup tasks

4. (Alternative) Run individual scripts in sequence:
   ```bash
   ./1_setup_pytorch_rocm_wsl.sh
   ```
   > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: You'll need to restart WSL during this process when prompted.

4. Install ComfyUI:
   ```bash
   ./2_install_comfyui.sh
   ```

5. Start ComfyUI:
   ```bash
   ./3_start_comfyui.sh
   ```
   > üí° **Tip**: You can pass additional arguments to ComfyUI, e.g., `./3_start_comfyui.sh --listen --port 8188`

6. Alternatively, install SD.Next:
   ```bash
   ./4_install_sdnext.sh
   ```
   > üí° **Tip**: After installation, you can run SD.Next with `cd ~/SD.Next && ./webui.sh --use-rocm`


## üñºÔ∏è Using ComfyUI
