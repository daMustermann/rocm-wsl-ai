## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 11 with WSL2 enabled
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS installed in WSL2
- Compatible AMD GPU:
  - RDNA3 (RX 7000 series) - Best performance
  - RDNA2 (RX 6000 series) - Great performance
  - RDNA1 (RX 5000 series) - Good performance
  - Vega (Vega 56/64, Radeon VII) - Compatible
  - Polaris (RX 400/500 series) - Basic compatibility
- Latest AMD drivers installed in Windows

### Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/daMustermann/rocm-wsl-ai.git
   cd rocm-wsl-ai
   ```

2. Make the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

3. (Recommended) Use the menu interface:
   ```bash
   ./0_ai_tools_menu.sh
   ```
   > 💡 **Tip**: The menu script provides an interactive interface for all installation and startup tasks

4. (Alternative) Run individual scripts in sequence:
   ```bash
   ./1_setup_pytorch_rocm_wsl.sh
   ```
   > ⚠️ **Note**: You'll need to restart WSL during this process when prompted.
